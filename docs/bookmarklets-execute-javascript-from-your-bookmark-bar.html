Wed 21 June 2023</h3><div><p>TLDR: I basically only use these for video speed control and skipping
	   ads, but there are much more creative things to be done with them.
	   You can skip to a list of <a href="#useful-snippets">bookmarklets I use</a>, or
	   read on for some background.</p><h3>Bookmarklets: Intro</h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet">Bookmarklets</a> are bookmarks
     that execute JavaScript code, instead of pointing to a resource on the web.
     Since they're not really <em>links</em>, they won't change the page you're currently on;
     instead, they will simply execute the code contained inside, and leave your browser
     pointing where it's currently pointing.</p><p>I personally use bookmarklets to have convenient, cross-site speed control for
       videos I play; I mostly use this for YouTube videos.  Not only does it provide
       a faster way to control speed, but it also allows conveniently changing to a speed
       greater than 2?, which is typically the highest the UI will provide.</p><p>There are lots of useful things you can do with bookmarklets.  For
	   inspiration, check out this list of
	   <a href="https://github.com/topics/bookmarklets">bookmarklet-related GitHub repositories</a>.</p><h3>Basic template</h3><p>As explained below, you'll want to make sure your snippet returns an
	undefined type.  The basic idea here is to create an anonymous function.
	The function body will include your snippet source code, and you'll immediately
	execute the funtion.</p><p>One possible structure then looks like this:

	 <pre><code>javacript: (() =&gt; { &lt;your code here&gt; })()</code></pre>

	 The snippet above defines an anonymous
	 <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions">arrow function</a>
	 containing your code, and immediately executes that function,
	 returning an undefined type.  Just place your JavaScript code
	 between the braces, and you're off to the races!</p><h3>Aside: URIs and syntax</h3><p>When I initially encountered bookmarklets, I took the <code>javascript:</code> as
	  a magic syntactical invocation, and I even (probably incorrectly)
	  recalled reading that this particular bit of syntax was browser-specific.
	  More accurately, as the
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet">Wikipedia article</a>
	  explains, it's a special
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#Syntax">URI scheme</a>.</p><p>Additionally, as a small aside, you should ensure your JS snippet returns an
		   undefined type.  This will ensure your &quot;link&quot; doesn't take you to
		   a new page.  If you don't ensure this, the browser will run your
		   snippet, and use the resulting string as the new page.</p><h3 id="useful-snippets">Useful snippets</h3><p>Here's a few bookmarklets I personally use.  Just like any link on the
	    web, you can right-click these and choose to &quot;bookmark&quot; the link- that
	    will actually save the bookmarklet, and allow you to execute the
	    JavaScript snippet by clicking the bookmark.<aside><strong>Important note:</strong> You really shouldn't execute code someone sends
		 you over the Internet without vetting it first; take a minute to
		 look over the target URL of these links to get a sense of what
		 they do before you save and execute them.</aside></p><h4>Video speed control</h4><p>These bookmarklets let you change the speed of a currently playing
	   video.  They've been tested on YouTube, and should work for other
	   similar platforms.<ul><li><a href="javascript: (() =&gt; {document.querySelector('video').playbackRate = 0.5})()">0.5?</a></li><li><a href="javascript: (() =&gt; {document.querySelector('video').playbackRate = 1.0})()">1?</a></li><li><a href="javascript: (() =&gt; {document.querySelector('video').playbackRate = 1.5})()">1.5?</a></li><li><a href="javascript: (() =&gt; {document.querySelector('video').playbackRate = 2.0})()">2?</a></li><li><a href="javascript: (() =&gt; {document.querySelector('video').playbackRate = 2.5})()">2.5?</a></li><li><a href="javascript: (() =&gt; {document.querySelector('video').playbackRate = 3.0})()">3?</a></li><li><a href="javascript: (() =&gt; {document.querySelector('video').playbackRate = 3.5})()">3.5?</a></li><li><a href="javascript: (() =&gt; {document.querySelector('video').playbackRate = 4.0})()">4?</a></li></ul>Note that the code here isn't particularly complicated; I've provided
	  different speeds here not because it's hard to change the code to the
	  speed you want, but just for convenience when adding them to your
	  browser.</p><h4>Skip video</h4><p>This bookmarklet lets you skip to the end of a video.  This is not
	  very useful in situations where you have scrubbing controls, but it
	  can be useful if you don't have those (e.g., ads ?)<ul><li><a href="javascript: (() =&gt; {document.querySelector('video').currentTime = document.querySelector('video').duration})()">Skip Video</a></li></ul></p><h3>Make your own!</h3><p>I'd love to find more interesting uses for these bookmarklets- learn
	 some JS, experiment, and post your favorite for others to see!  I'm
	 not personally such a huge fan of JS as a language, but one of the
	 nice features is its availability- if you find out how to do something
	 cool with JS, you can instantly share it with almost everyone you
	 know.  Happy hacking!</p></div></body>
